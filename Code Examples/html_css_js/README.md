<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</p>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it describes the structure of a Web page and consists of a series of elements. These elements tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements are represented by tags that are label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Notice that browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page</p>
