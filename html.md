# HTML

## What is HTML?

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it describes the structure of a Web page and consists of a series of elements. These elements tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements are represented by tags that are label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Notice that browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.

## Basic HTML Structure

* Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello HTML!</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

* Tags used in Example explained:

`<!DOCTYPE html>` defines this document is HTML5
`<html>` is the root element of an HTML page
`<head>` contains meta information about the document
`<title>` specifies a title for the document
`<body>` contains the visible page content
`<h1>` defines a large heading
`<p>` defines a paragraph

> Also note that every opening element or `<tag>` has its own closing element `</tag>` at it's end.

HTML can be written in any text editor such as Notes, Notepad, Sublime Text, VS Code, ect. And it also must be saved with the file extension of `.html`
