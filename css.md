# CSS
## What is CSS?
**CSS** stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. It also describes the style of an **HTML** document.

## Basic CSS Structure

* Syntax Example

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

> In the example above the `body`, `h1` and `p` sections are called **selectors** and inside the **curly braces** `{}` must lie the **declaration** of the style properties to be applied to these **selectors**

* Tags used in Example explained:
  * CSS can be selected 
  
```css

<html> is the root element of an HTML page
<head> contains meta information about the document
<title> specifies a title for the document
<body> contains the visible page content
<h1> defines a large heading
<p> defines a paragraph
```

> Also note that every opening element or `<tag>` has its own closing element `</tag>` at it's end.

CSS can be written in any text editor such as Notes, Notepad, Sublime Text, VS Code, ect. And it also must be saved with the file extension of `.css`
